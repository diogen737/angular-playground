# Angular Playground

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/diogen737/angular-playground.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/diogen737/angular-playground)

Welcome to my Angular sandbox where I test concepts, techniques and libs new to me.

## Build & run

You can clone this repository and play around:

```#!/bin/bash
yarn
yarn run start
```

Or you can run the site in production mode:

```#!/bin/bash
yarn
ng build --prod
node server.js
```

If you don't have `yarn` installed on your machine [check it out](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#debian-stable).
